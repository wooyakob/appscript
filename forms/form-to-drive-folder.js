// Customer:
// If can start with google forms that’d be great
// Everything is attached to a Property Address
// Once status of a house goes “Under Contract” I will use x as an example

// Creates folder in "Google Drive”
// Is there a way to auto make folders inside the “property address” such as the 1 Frontside, 2 Middle, 3 Backside?
// Put copies of google sheet templates on Frontside “Property Analysis“ ,  “Rehab budget”
